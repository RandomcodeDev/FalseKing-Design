== Music
There will be three types of track for each region: exploration music, combat music, and boss music. There might be a few varieties of each, and they'll be cycled between. This system isn't too dissimilar to how Faster Than Light handles music.

== Sound effects
There will be sounds for different attacks and actions, and sound cues when certain things happen, such as discovering a new area or defeating a combat encounter (much like Breath of the Wild).
