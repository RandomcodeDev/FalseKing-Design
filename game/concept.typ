== Gameplay overview
There are three main parts of the gameplay: combat, exploration, and puzzles. While exploring, the player can find NPCs, points of interest, and easter eggs. Some areas will feature traps and simplistic puzzles to open doors and reveal things. During both exploration and puzzles, the player will encounter combat. The player will be able to attack enemies and defend themself with different elemental abilities.
