== Inspiration
The general layout of the world and some aspects of the gameplay are heavily inspired by Hyper Light Drifter.

== Player experience
The player will have the chance to explore, talk to NPCs, solve puzzles, and fight a variety of enemies using their elemental powers, which can be combined together to make even stronger effects.

== Target audience
The game will have multiple difficulty levels, to allow both casual and advanced players alike to enjoy the game as they choose.

== Availability
The game will be available wherever possible, and the price will be equivalent to 20 Canadian dollars, and in places where that's expensive (such as Brazil), it'll be cheaper so people are less likely to pirate it.

== Translations
Translations into French, Russian, and Polish are possible.
